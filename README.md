# Java-maven-app


The repository contains a Java application which outputs the string
"Hello world!" and is accompanied by a couple of unit tests to check that the
main application works as expected. The results of these tests are saved to a
JUnit XML report.

The `jenkins` directory contains an `Jenkinsfile` (i.e. Pipeline) `scripts` subdirectory
containing a shell script with commands that are executed when Jenkins processes
the "Deliver" stage of your Pipeline.
